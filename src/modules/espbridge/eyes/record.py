"""Capture a single face to a GIF, headless -- develop the eyes with no OLED.

Drives a fresh EyeEngine off a virtual clock (no thread, no sleep) so a 30-second
clip renders as fast as the CPU allows. One-shot gestures are re-fired to fill the
clip. See docs/make_gif.py for the labelled showcase of every face.
